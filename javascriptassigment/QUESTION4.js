//cooma operators can be used to insatlised multiple values together 
console.log(4,5,6,7);
//output will be 4 5 6 7

//we can use this operator in conditional looping also
for(a=1,b=2,c=3;a<10,b<12,c<13;a++,b++,c++){
    console.log(a,b,c);
}
//here we have multiple for loop conditions together and running together
